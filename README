I have Solution, 
1. clone source code
2. open launcher/minecraft/MinecraftInstance.cpp
3. find makeShared<AssetUpdateTask>(this),
4. remark it.
5. recompile it , here is instructions : https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions
Now you can have a version of Prism Launcher who never update Asset index. you can use is to play, when you do not have internet.
I do not know what further to do, but this for me is a reasonable Solution anyway....

if you wanna a copy you can contact me
